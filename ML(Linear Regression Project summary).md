******* SUMMARY FOR ML(Linear Regressiom) to predict the housing price*******
I'm excited to share my latest project where I applied ML(Machine Learning) to explore and analyze a dataset of housing price prediction for analysis of the correlation between the Given dataset.
In this project,  𝐈 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 ML in linear regression — 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐬𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐬 𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲! — and worked with real-world  data to answer important predictive questions.
�� Predicting House Prices - Linear Regression Project (Highlights)

Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features (like area, location, etc.).
Approach:
* Data cleaning and exploration.
* Feature selection and engineering.
* Applied Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression models.
Key Techniques:
* Correlation analysis to find impactful variables.
* Train-test split for model validation.
* Evaluation metrics: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Result:

* Developed a regression model that accurately predicts house prices.
* Achieved a high R² score, indicating good model performance.
* Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
Impact:

Helps buyers and sellers make data-driven decisions.
Demonstrates real-world application of machine learning in the real estate industry.
